# LBYARCH Programming Project 2
## About the Project
### Description
This project aims to compare and analyze the execution time of C and x86-64 assembly in both debug and release mode. For this purpose, a short program was created to calculate the sum of every seven elements (single-precision float) in an array, and these results are then stored in a separate array. The program follows this format: <br>
### Y[i] = X[i-3] + X[i-2] + X[i-1] + X[i] + X[i+1] + X[i+2] + X[i+3]
An example can be seen below:
### Input: X-> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
### Output: Y-> 28, 35
