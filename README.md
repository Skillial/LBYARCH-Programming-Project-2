# LBYARCH Programming Project 2
## About the Project
### Description
This project aims to compare and analyze the execution time of C and x86-64 assembly in both debug and release mode. For this purpose, a short program was created to calculate the sum of every seven elements in an array. It follows this format:
Y[i] = X[i-3] + X[i-2] + X[i-1] + X[i] + X[i+1] + X[i+2] + X[i+3]
